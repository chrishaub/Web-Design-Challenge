# Web Design - HTML - CSS - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

Worked with HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis that was completed.

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

Created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations created in a past projectg. Specifically, plotted [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, created individual pages for each plot and a means by which can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. Created a landing page, page where can see a comparison of all of the plots.

### Website 

The website consists of 2 pages, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to a visualizations page. A sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.
*  [visualization page](#visualization-page):
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

The website, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to the visualization page.
